Civil Auras Changelog
=======

# 1.5.0
* (Hopefully) fixed an unlimited talent exploit - talentbooks now only grant a talent to a specific character once. Respecing won't bypass this.
* Restructured trader item generation to only spawn one book (per skill) at a time - Players usually only need one specific book per character anyway.
* Bartering bonuses and trade generation are now properly applied when requesting trade through dialog.
* Trade generation now refreshes on level up.
* Pep Talk memorization requirements reduced to 3 persuasion (from 5).
